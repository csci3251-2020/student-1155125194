# Self-introduction

Hey there! I'm Vincent Wong, a student of Computer Science in CUHK. I'm also known as `Vectorial1024` in various places on the Internet, with the exception of Nexus Mod Forums where I am `PrecisionVector`. (When I was unifying my Internet aliases, I realized that they don't allow users to change their username... oh well.)

## An Early Start

My first time with programming dates back to when I was still a kid, playing around with a programming-capable old-fashioned laptop-like toy, greatly offended that I cannot save a program, which I wrote based on one of the several modifiable programs, into that toy itself (*yeah, kids*). A few years later, with the help of a left-over C programming book from my family, I learnt how to write buggy C programs.

And a few years later, with me entering secondary school, and by meeting a new friend there, I was motivated to try C++, and made a working battle simulator for the game Risk (actual file probably deleted/buried too deep). From that point onwards, I knew enough about programming that I can easily self-learn things, but I still have no idea what programming actually is.

Of course, all of this did not come without any drawbacks. With me learning more and more about programming, but other kids talking about playing sports, watching cartoon (anime?), and perhaps some other topics that are too obscure for me to understand (uh, TVB drama...? Celebrities?), I don't have many friends. If you ever met me in person, you may find me quiet and not sociable, and that is normal, because I kinda got used to not needing to interact with anyone. *Socially-awkward, oh yeah!*

And yes, anime is life.

## The Journey

As I self-learned things throughout the years, I tried these things (in order):

- A (simplified?) version of BASIC
- General-purpose C
- General-purpose C++
- Joining GitHub
- MineCraft modding with Java (Java setup failed and got perma-banned from Forge Forums for asking for help too frequently; now hates Java somewhat)
- Simple web system in an extra school project using basic HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, PHP, and SQL (unexpected non-salvagable fatal bug in live production, now slightly scared when using them)
- RimWorld modding with C#
- Cities: Skylines modding with C#
- Basic TypeScript

In addition, I also picked these up from elsewhere:

- Intermediate SQL

## Wishlist

In the future, I hope to:

- [ ] Consolidate what I have messily learnt throughout the years
- [ ] Re-learn GitHub using cmd, instead of using GUI
- [ ] Read news
- [ ] Think
- [ ] Watch anime
- [ ] Continue to make mods in free time (if there are any)
- [ ] Enjoy life
